Introduction

1 Wild Camping

Wild camping differs to conventional camping as it is performed in wild spaces, outside of domestic campsites, as a result the preparation and overall experience of wild camping is somewhat different to conventional camping. It is viewed as an extreme activity (Macnaghten & Urry, 2000) due to the increased responsibility one has for their own survival coupled with the lack of facilities, however people of any age can experience it and feel confident doing so after a bit of research. Scotland is the only country in the United Kingdom where wild camping is legal, the Scottish Government have published a number of documents to aid those who wish to experience the activity that I have included in my research.

2 Social Media

Social media, although a relatively new source of communication, has established itself in societies across the world. Keeping up with friends, reconnecting with old ones and making new ones, social networks are buzzing with activity. In 2013, Facebook published that an average of 4.75 billion items of content were shared on their site per day (Facebook, 2013). Posting of original content and sharing of viral memes and other information is happening at a mind boggling rate, however publicly sharing sensitive information to an unknown audience is not always a good thing. Publicly sharing an event, such as a house party, on social media has proven to have dire consequences (Frith, 2012). There are examples all over the world where publicly shared information has been abused by a significantly large group of people.

3 Environmental Issues

Societies and businesses are under immense pressure to recognise environmental issues and their own impact on the environment. Large cities have been defaced of all wild aspects with some people claiming many parts of rural Scotland are also becoming defaced by building projects such as the instillation of wind turbines (Leharne, 2014), but many truly wild spaces do still exist. The Neolithic Revolution saw many human cultures transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture and settlement (Bocquet-Appel, 2011). Since settling in towns and cities many of us have forgotten how to respect our surroundings and nature. By visiting these wild spaces, we are damaging them and removing the very characteristics that cause us to initially seek a connection with them. Many popular tourist destinations including Mt. Everest (Figueroa, 2013) and coral reefs around the world (Bryant, et al., 1999) are examples where human activity is causing catastrophic environmental degradation. The Scottish Highlands have their own environmental issues that must be dealt with accordingly (Sleight, 2011).

4 Progression

As the population of Scotland, the United Kingdom and the rest of the world increases, the amount of activity in Scottish wild spaces is undoubtedly going to increase with it. We cannot assume that these wild spaces will be visited by 100% responsible people and that the increase in activity will see an increase in care and consideration for the locations themselves. An increase in activity but no increase in maintenance will be the overall reason for the destruction of wild spaces in Scotland.

5 Crowdsourcing

Crowdsourcing has become a popular method of collecting various types of data as seen in the success of early crowdsourcing projects such as Wikipedia, relying on the knowledge of a vast amount of people to create quality content rather than the individual creating the tool supplying all of the information. Crowdsourcing is proven to be an effective method of collecting location data, as seen in the success of OpenStreetMap, and additional data related to specific locations as seen in the success of travel review sites such as TripAdvisor.

6 Purpose

The problem my project is addressing is the lack of affordance for wild campers seeking wild locations. Public broadcasting of locations is frowned upon by the wild camping community, when locations are shared online they receive interest from an increased amount of people due to the lack of publicly accessible locations. This in turn puts these wild locations under immense pressure as they are now known by a large number of people.  
To address this problem, I will create a crowdsourcing tool in which wild campers submit wild camping locations and in doing so become a moderator for those locations. Moderators are then able to regulate the distribution of their submitted locations to other users at their own discretion. 
In addition, I wish to use this crowdsourced information in the interests of wild campers and wild locations alike, there are a number of benefits to collecting this data. 

•	Coordination of use;

•	Prevention of overuse; 

•	Coordination of maintenance.

The crowdsourced information will be fundamental to the progression of the wild camping community in Scotland as much of wild camping activity goes undocumented. As a result, the creation of small communities of wild campers centred on specific wild locations would be the basis for a collective of environmental guardians that watch over wild locations to protect them from the risks they face in the future. As stated on the Scottish government’s website, tourism is everyone’s business – everyone in Scotland is an ambassador.
